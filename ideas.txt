2. Magnetic Hover Buttons
Make CTA buttons slightly "pull" toward the cursor on hover, using motion springs or custom CSS.
Also apply this to your project titles or nav links for an immersive feel.

7. Live Project Simulator
Hovering over a portfolio card triggers an iframe showing the live website (mini version).
Click opens full project case study.

## üß© Recommended Tech Stack Enhancements for ACE Portfolio

---

### 1. **UI Component Libraries**
#### ‚úÖ `shadcn/ui` (you're already using it)  
- **Continue leveraging it** for: forms, modals, alerts, and tabs.
- Use it for **Dark Mode toggle**, animated cards, and beautiful **radix-based dropdowns**.

#### üåø `Chakra UI` (alternative or for clients)  
- Keep this in your **toolkit for client work**, especially when you want to rapidly scaffold dashboards or SaaS UIs.
- On your site, mention it in a ‚ÄúTech Stack I Use‚Äù section.

> ‚úÖ Suggestion: Show a component playground section where visitors can toggle between Chakra UI and Shadcn to show versatility.

---

### 2. **Animation & Interaction**
#### üåê `Framer Motion`
- Already a staple‚Äîuse it for:
  - Page transitions
  - Section reveal animations
  - Timeline scroll effects
  - Magnetic hover effects

#### ‚ú® `GSAP` (GreenSock)
- Great for scroll-driven animations:
  - Pinning
  - Timeline scrub
  - Image sequence scroll animations
- Use it on a dedicated ‚ÄúPlayground‚Äù or ‚ÄúCreative Experiments‚Äù page.

#### üéØ `LottieFiles` (via `lottie-react`)
- Use for microinteractions or animated section intros.
- Load fast, scalable, and very UI/UX designer friendly.

---

### 3. **3D / Creative Code**
#### üåÄ `Three.js` + `@react-three/fiber`
- Add a **3D interactive scene** in your hero or a section titled:
  > _"We don't just build interfaces, we craft experiences."_
- Examples:
  - Interactive 3D version of your logo
  - Floating 3D cube showing services (hover to rotate & click to reveal)
  - An immersive 3D grid background (subtle, animated with mouse parallax)

#### ‚ú® `R3F + Drei` for convenience
- For easy controls, orbit cameras, lighting, and postprocessing.

> üí° Bonus: Add a toggle to switch from 2D to 3D experience mode.

---

### 4. **Motion & Scroll Libraries**
#### ü™Ñ `Lenis` (scroll smoothing)
- Beautiful and buttery smooth scrolling experience (a must).

#### üîó `Locomotive Scroll` (if you want snapping scroll)
- Not needed if using Lenis + Framer, but good for scroll-jacked storytelling pages.

---

### 5. **Visual Effects**
#### üß¨ `react-tsparticles`
- You're already using it‚Äîexpand with:
  - **Modes**: bubble, repulse, grab
  - **Network style with pulsing nodes**
  - **React to cursor** or scroll position

#### üì∑ `react-parallax` or custom div-based effects
- Parallax gallery scrolling for project showcases.
- Each column or image scrolls at a different speed.

---

### 6. **AI / Dynamic Content**
#### üß† `OpenAI API` or `Replicate`
- Add an "AI Assistant" to:
  - Help users find the right service
  - Generate a custom quote
  - Walk clients through the onboarding process

#### üìÉ `mdx-bundler` or `next-mdx-remote`
- Use MDX to manage your blog or case study content with custom React components.
