We are a startup business called ACE consisting of 2 computer science students who want to build websites for businesses, focusing on small ones for the starting period. 
Build a landing page website which will be used as our portfolio where different websites we build will be linked on. 
The aim is to send this website to our potential clients so they can view our skills and look at our work. 
Also, our package prices will be included in a "Packages" page.
